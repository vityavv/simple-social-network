	<h1>Victor's simple social network</h1>
	<p>This is the simplest social network anyone could make. I mean, technically it isn't, but it's pretty close. You can enter the name of your post, and the body of your post. Then, you can see other posts.</p>
	<p>After 50 posts the oldest post gets removed</p>
	<h3>Submit a post</h3>
	Name: <input id="name" /><br>
	Body:<br>
	<textarea id="body"></textarea>

	<h3>Other posts</h3>
	<div id="otherposts">
